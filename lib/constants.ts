      whatHappened: `The episode begins with MrBeast announcing the grand prize of $5,000,000, and introduces the 1,000 contestants who were not eliminated 
        in the initial YouTube video. He begins by offering $1,000,000, split by the amount of people who take that offer. In the end, 52 people
         walk away with about $19,230 in hand. In the first game, MrBeast gives the contestants 10 minutes to let one person eliminate themselves
          so that the remaining players in their column can continue to the next game. The game ends with 3 columns being fully eliminated. In 
          the second game, MrBeast asks contestants to stack blocks with varying widths, on top of a red starting block, within 10 minutes. If 
          one couldn't stack the blocks in time, or one's stack falls down, they are eliminated. By the end, 605 players remain. In the final 
          round, MrBeast offers contestants increasing amounts of money, but with a catch: by taking the money, they will eliminate themselves
           and everyone else in their row. The prize money reaches up to $1,000,000, and 493 players move on to Beast City, introduced in 
           Episode 2.`,

      whatHappened: `493 players settle in Beast City. The players line up to receive 4 tokens, with hints on them, corresponding to the 4 floors they 
        may go to to participate for the next game, and MrBeast allows them to trade tokens. The first game happens on the 4th floor, where 
        selected players split up into 2 teams, on 2 sides of the tower. MrBeast's crew drop balls onto the ceiling, which has periodic holes.
         The balls may drop from any of these holes, and if any balls hit the floor, that team is eliminated. The team on the left side is 
         eliminated. The players who have a token of 2 go up to the second floor, and separate into 2 teams. The objective is to have the
          least amount of people on one side, so that side moves on, and the leaving players are eliminated. MrBeast adds a telephone in 
          both areas to make the game more interesting. In the end, the right-sided team moves on. The players with a 3 token, split into
           2 teams on the third floor. A giant red cup is added in the centre, and each player is given a ball to throw. Each successful 
           throw earns the team a point. In the middle of the game, MrBeast adds a gold cup, and with each successful throw here, the thrower 
           earns $250,000, but no points for the team. In the end, the team on the left won. Players with a token of one went to the first 
           floor, split in 2 teams, and participated in a simple quiz game. Players of each team, split further into teams, and would come
            down to battle with the other team's teams for points. The team with the most points would move on. In the end, the team on the 
            left would move on. The remaining players split into 4 teams, wherein each team selected a captain: Harrison, Deano, Twana, and 
            Jeremy. These captains were given increasing bribes up to $1,000,000; if they accepted the bribe, their whole team (excluding themselves)
             would be eliminated.`,

       potato sack race. One player from the team competes in the race, and the winning team wins a special house gaining them immunity for 
       the upcoming challenge. In this challenge, the teams are given their own rooms, with handcuffs on the walls, and a telephone to have 
       anything delivered to their room. MrBeast announces that all teams have 5 hours to choose one person who is handcuffed to the wall, 
       thereby being eliminated, which helps the other team members qualify for the next game, and if nobody is chosen by the end of 5 hours,
        then all members are eliminated. Contestants are allowed to request any item by phone; these items range from food to games of chance 
        and other objects. By the end of the 5 hours, 94 people are eliminated. Notably, two brothers (the "Habibi Brothers") manipulate a
         woman in their box into eliminating herself; they later brag about this to others, while Harrison ends up eliminating himself. The 
         next day, MrBeast brings out a golden gift box, and the first person to touch it wins whatever is inside. The winner is awarded a 
         ticket for the first of nine helicopters taking contestants to "Beast Island", the location of the next set of challenges, and can
          choose five others to join them in the helicopter. MrBeast announces that another ticket to Beast Island is hidden in the city.`,

        receives 5 additional tickets from MrBeast to choose others for the helicopter. With 7 helicopters remaining, MrBeast initiates a ball-holding 
        challenge where blindfolded contestants must drop their balls closest to a 10-minute timer, with the 6 closest advancing. In the next challenge, 
        contestants must collect coins from others, with the winner receiving a ticket and 5 more to distribute. Teams then compete in a glass ball relay 
        race, where 3 teams advance to Beast Island. In a tense blindfolded challenge around the helicopter pad, contestants must decide whether to step 
        into an inner circle within 60 seconds - multiple people stepping in results in elimination, while a sole stepper receives a ticket and can choose 
        5 others. MrBeast then offers $250,000 split between those willing to quit, which 13 people accept. The remaining contestants throw balls at a 
        golden briefcase, with the closest throw winning a ticket and 5 to distribute. Finally, groups of six compete on platforms to collect each other's 
        coins, with only one person per platform advancing to Beast Island. All others are eliminated.`,

      caught by Navy SEALs, with the first person caught being eliminated. Next, players competed in a coconut throwing challenge where they
       had to throw coconuts down a path without crossing a red line - the two players who either threw shortest or crossed the line first
        were eliminated. A boat then arrived with players from the main island, who were given the chance to vote off one of the 6 remaining 
        private island players. Before revealing the votes, Jimmy offered private island players the option to leave and join the main island 
        if they feared receiving the most votes, but no one took the offer. In the following game, players elected a captain who 
        placed 1 X and 4 O's in boxes numbered 1-5. The captain chose the order players picked boxes and could suggest which box to pick. 
        After 4 players chose boxes, the captain had to take the remaining one, with whoever got the X being eliminated. 
        The remaining 4 players were taken to a pirate ship with real cannons, 
        where Jimmy offered $450,000 in gold (quarter of the island's value) to leave the game, available in the order from the previous 
        box-picking game. The first player took the offer, preventing others from claiming it. In the final challenge,
         players chose between boards numbered 1, 3, and 5 to advance spaces, but identical choices cancelled out. The winner earned the 
         right to choose their opponent for the final battle for the private island.`,

      whatHappened: `Continuing from the previous episode, the two remaining island competitors (Mia and Brennan) compete in one last game
       for the rights to the island. Each contestant is given two briefcases; one contains a deed to the island, while the other contains
        an X. The contestants swap cases until one player has both deeds, thus winning the island, and the right to stay in the main 
        competition: Mia wins, while Brennan is eliminated. Back at Beast City, the remaining 52 competitors are given a choice 
        between 3 games; a physical game, a mental game, and a chance game. 19 contestants chose the mental game, a trivia competition
         where the contestants were ranked based on their intelligence, giving the highest ranked players the right to choose their opponents.
          Akira (Player 539) selects Karim (Player 406, one half of the "Habibi Brothers") as his opponent, stating his desire for both 
          brothers to be eliminated due to their manipulative behavior during episode 3. 11 contestants, including Karim and his brother 
          Hazim (Player 527), were eliminated in the mental game. 16 contestants chose to play the chance game, in which a number of
           contestants were chosen to be eliminated through randomly assigned trapdoors. 12 contestants were eliminated in the chance game. 
           The remaining 17 contestants chose the physical games, in which two teams of 8 would compete in games that would test 
           their strength, speed, and stamina. As the games required an even number of players among both teams, the last player who 
           wasn't picked by either team captain would be eliminated. The pink team won the first physical game, where both teams pushed a
            monster truck in hopes of getting theirs to the finish line first before the other team. The orange team would win the second game,
             a series of sprints to grab flags on a football field; the flag would be placed further on the field with each round. For the third and 
             final physical game, both teams were tasked to pick one contestant each for a dead hang challenge; whoever let go and fell first would be 
             eliminated, as such eliminating their entire team. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, as the two selected contestants hang high above the 
             city.

        winners of the Physical game with the 9 winners of the Mental game and the 4 winners of the Chance game. The 21 contestants are
         then taken to an "Elimination Train" challenge located on railroad tracks, where they must eliminate other contestants based on 
         the trolley problem. Akira is elected as captain and must decide whether he will win a Lamborghini sports car at the cost of 
         eliminating his three least favorite players (including Mia, who won the private island). After choosing to eliminate the three 
         players, who are all Black women, Mia accuses Akira of racism and misogynism, which other players dispute. Akira is again voted as 
         captain. This round, he is forced to choose whether he will sacrifice his best friend, Cole (Player 359), or his next three least 
         favorite players and a Tesla luxury car. Akira chooses to save Cole. Bucking the trend, the players vote Player 865 as captain in
          the third round. She selects Akira and Cole as her two least favorite contestants, and then is forced to decide between saving her 
          best friend (Player 424) or Akira, Cole and a "mystery player". After saving her best friend, it is revealed that the captain was 
          the "mystery player", so she has additionally eliminated herself. In the final round, Twana is elected as captain. She selects a 
          player she trusts (Queen) and a player that she does not trust (Deano) to each stand on one train track. Queen and Deano then each 
          select a player to stand with them on their train track, thus opening that player up to elimination. Deano selects Jaz (Player 697), 
          believing that her closeness with Twana may save him from elimination, whereas Queen selects her friend JC (Player 566). In the end, 
          Twana is left in a dilemma as the Elimination Train approaches.

      Train challenge. The players return to Beast City to discover a large black mystery box, a renovated tower with floors numbered 
      1 to 10, and numbered houses also from 1 to 10. After a brief interlude where contestants are reunited with their families, MrBeast 
      reveals that each contestant will be sleeping in their own house. The players vote on who will get the key to House 1; they unanimously
       choose Twana after MrBeast hints that lower-numbered houses will be advantageous in future rounds. Twana picks Michael to stay in House 
       2, Michael picks JC to stay in House 3, JC picks Emma to stay in House 4, and so on until Yesenia gets the key to House 9, leaving 
       Queen in House 10. The mystery box is revealed to contain $1,000,000: starting with Twana in House 1, each contestant will come out 
       one by one and anonymously take their desired amount of the $1,000,000. Twana goes first and takes $100,000, hoping that the other 9 
       continue the trend and split it evenly. However, Michael then takes $223,000. JC is third, and after revealing that he has debts of 
       approximately $530,000, he takes $650,000, leaving $27,000. Emma takes $5,000, reacting with disgust; Patrick takes nothing, as he
        believes that the money is "bait from MrBeast". Jeff takes $7,272. The last four players split the remaining $14,728 equally. 
        Soon after, the contestants are reunited and quickly determine that Michael and JC took more than their "fair share" of $100,000. 
        Although he tries to justify his need for the money, a large rift forms between JC and the other players. The next morning,
         JC again attempts to explain why he took the money, with little success, and warns the players that Gage, Jeff, 
         Patrick and himself were in a secret alliance. MrBeast calls the players to the tower with the numbered floors and reveals the next 
         challenge: a vote to determine the six players who advance to the final challenge of Beast Games. The contestants are allowed 
         one hour and their share of the $1,000,000 to convince and bribe other players to vote for them.`,
